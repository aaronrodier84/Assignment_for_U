# Assignment Overview
Overview: Build a simple web app that verifies whether the user owns an NFT in a collection of 10,000 NFTs.
Requirements: The web app should have 3 pages as listed below and nothing else. A wireframe exists for each of the pages below. The implementation should be as close to the wireframe but we
aren’t looking at the visual so much as we are looking at the functionality and your understanding of Web3 technologies.

* Page 1: A place where the user clicks a button to connect their Metamask wallet for verification.
* Page 2: A progress screen that shows the system is verifying for the existence of the a specific NFT.
* Page 3: A confirmation page that tells the user whether the NFT was found in their wallet or not.

Web Front-end Technologies:
For this assignment, we would like you to use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap for CSS layout as well as any JS/Web3 libraries you wish to use. You can use any server side web
technology you’d like. Use anything except React and Angular.

To run this app on your local side:

`npm install`

`npm start`
